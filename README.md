## 1. Quick Start (Run from Source)

Requires **Python 3.10+** (developed & tested on 3.13).

```bash
# 1. Clone / download this repo
# 2. Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt

# 3. Run the app
python JustDownloadIT.py
```

On first run on Windows, if `ffmpeg.exe` is not found on PATH or in `ffmpeg_bin/`, the app will **download it automatically**. See next section.

---

## 2. Getting ffmpeg

`ffmpeg` is required for merging video/audio DASH streams, MP3 extraction, and timestamp clip-cutting.

**Windows:**
- **Automatic (recommended):** On first launch, if `ffmpeg.exe` is missing, the app downloads `ffmpeg-release-essentials.zip` from [gyan.dev/ffmpeg/builds](https://www.gyan.dev/ffmpeg/builds/), extracts only `ffmpeg.exe` into `ffmpeg_bin/`, and deletes the zip. ~80 MB one-time download.
- **Manual:** Download ffmpeg from the URL above and place `ffmpeg.exe` in a `ffmpeg_bin/` folder next to `JustDownloadIT.py` (or add it to your system `PATH`).

**Mac / Linux:**
- Install ffmpeg via your package manager: `brew install ffmpeg` (macOS) or `sudo apt install ffmpeg` (Ubuntu/Debian).

> ⚠️ **ffmpeg.exe is NOT committed to this repository** due to its size and separate licensing (ffmpeg is distributed under LGPL/GPL). The app handles acquisition for you.

---

## 3. Build a Standalone .EXE (no Python needed for end users)

First make sure you have `ffmpeg.exe` in `ffmpeg_bin/` (see [Getting ffmpeg](#2-getting-ffmpeg)).

### Option A — One-liner (recommended for this project):

```bash
pyinstaller --onefile --windowed --name JustDownloadIT --add-binary "ffmpeg_bin/ffmpeg.exe;ffmpeg_bin" JustDownloadIT.py
```

This produces **`dist\JustDownloadIT.exe`** (~53 MB). That one file is the entire app — it:
- Bundles Python runtime
- Bundles yt-dlp + all dependencies
- Bundles ffmpeg.exe (extracted into a per-launch temp dir via `_MEIPASS`)
- Uses `--windowed` (no console window pops up)

### Option B — Use the pre-built `JustDownloadIT.spec`:

```bash
pyinstaller JustDownloadIT.spec
```

Same output, uses the `.spec` file that was hand-tuned to bundle `ffmpeg_bin/ffmpeg.exe`.

### Option C — Self-generated build script (for sharing the build):

Give just `JustDownloadIT.py` to someone. On a Windows PC with Python:

```bash
python JustDownloadIT.py --make-build-script
```

This writes `build_windows.bat` next to the `.py` file. Double-click the `.bat` — it installs
`yt-dlp` + `pyinstaller` and runs the exact command above.

### Post-build manual verification checklist:

1. `dist\JustDownloadIT.exe` exists (size ≈ 50–70 MB)
2. Copy it to an empty folder on a **different machine without Python** (or to `standalone_test/` locally)
3. Double-click — window opens, no missing DLL / missing module errors
4. Paste any YouTube URL, click **Add**, then **Download** — it should find ffmpeg (from the bundle)

---

## 4. Build the Windows Installer (.Setup.exe)

Once you have a working `JustDownloadIT.exe` build, you can wrap it into a proper Windows installer using **Inno Setup**.

### Prerequisites:
- **Inno Setup 6** installed (download from [jrsoftware.org/isinfo.php](https://jrsoftware.org/isinfo.php))
- A working build at `release_build\dist\JustDownloadIT.exe` (copy it from `dist\` if you built it there)
- `app_icon.ico` in the project root (already included)

### Build steps:

```bash
# 1. (Optional) If you built to dist\, copy the EXE to release_build\dist\ first
mkdir -p release_build\dist
copy dist\JustDownloadIT.exe release_build\dist\JustDownloadIT.exe

# 2. Compile the installer using ISCC (Inno Setup Compiler)
#    Typical ISCC paths (use whichever exists):
"C:\Program Files (x86)\Inno Setup 6\ISCC.exe" installer.iss
# -- or --
"C:\Program Files\Inno Setup 6\ISCC.exe" installer.iss
```

This produces **`installer_output\JustDownloadIT-Setup.exe`**. The installer:
- Installs per-user to `%LOCALAPPDATA%\JustDownloadIT` (no admin rights required)
- Creates Desktop and Start Menu shortcuts using `app_icon.ico`
- Offers a "Launch JustDownloadIT" checkbox on the Finish page
- Adds an entry to Windows "Add/Remove Programs"

### Final release-ready setup.exe location:
Copy the compiled installer to `release\JustDownloadIT-Setup.exe` for upload to GitHub Releases.

---

## 5. Pre-built Releases (GitHub Releases)

Once this repository is published to GitHub, pre-built `JustDownloadIT-Setup.exe` installers will be available under the **Releases** tab of the repository. Users can simply download the latest `.Setup.exe` and double-click to install — no Python or build tools required.

Check [Releases](https://github.com/onstageCaspeR/JustDownloadIT/releases) after uploading the first build.

## 6. App Features (How To Use)

| Feature | Location / How |
|---|---|
| Paste URL | URL field at top, or click **📋 Paste** |
| Full video download | Leave mode on **Full Video** (default) |
| Clip a segment (timestamp range) | Toggle **Timestamp Clip** mode, enter Start/End in `HH:MM:SS`, `MM:SS`, or seconds |
| Format choice | **Video (MP4)** or **Audio only (MP3)** (format dropdown) |
| Quality choice | Best, 2160p, 1440p, 1080p, 720p, 480p, 360p |
| Output folder | **Browse** under *Save to:* — defaults to `~/Downloads` |
| Single-download now | **⬇ Download** — adds URL to queue and starts |
| Batch queue | Add multiple via **＋ Add**, then **▶ Process Queue** |
| Remove queue item | Click **✕** on any queued/failed/skipped row |
| Remove all | **🗑 Clear** |
| Open file after download | **📂** icon appears to the right of a completed item row |
| History | *Recent Downloads* panel at bottom (last 5, persists) |
| ffmpeg setup (Windows) | Fully automatic on first run |

### How download processing works

1. `yt_dlp.YoutubeDL` downloads video + audio streams separately (for resolutions above ~720p, YouTube serves them as separate DASH streams).
2. `ffmpeg` merges them into a single `.mp4` file.
3. For MP3 mode, `ffmpeg` extracts audio to `.mp3` (192 kbps) via `FFmpegExtractAudio` post-processor.
4. For clips, `yt-dlp`'s `download_ranges` + `force_keyframes_at_cuts` sends the cut range to ffmpeg during the merge step.
5. Progress (%/speed/ETA) and status icons (⏸ queued / ⏳ downloading / ✓ done / ✕ failed / → skipped) update live in the queue list.

---

## 7. Architecture (Single-File)

Everything lives in **`JustDownloadIT.py`** — no imports of sibling Python modules.

### Top-level module structure

| Lines (approx) | Block | Purpose |
|---|---|---|
| 1–26 | Module docstring | Quick-start & build instructions for devs |
| 28–45 | Imports | `tkinter`, `yt_dlp`, threading, urllib, zipfile, shutil, … |
| 47–92 | Constants | Paths (`APP_DIR`, `FFMPEG_DIR`, `RECENT_FILE`), color palette, font tuples |
| 95–243 | Free functions | `find_ffmpeg`, `download_ffmpeg_windows`, `parse_timestamp`, `format_speed`, `format_eta`, `load_recent`, `save_recent`, `open_folder`, `quality_to_format`, `fetch_video_duration` |
| 245–431 | Custom widgets | `IceButton`, `RoundedPanel`, `RoundedEntry`, `IconButton`, `QualityCombobox`, `ProgressWithLabel`, `SuccessBanner` |
| 437–454 | Data class | `DownloadQueueItem` (dataclass-ish POJO, no decorator) |
| 530–1387 | Main app `JustDownloadITApp` | Constructor → `_setup_styles` → `_build_ui` → download/queue/ffmpeg methods |
| 1390–1418 | `BUILD_SCRIPT_CONTENT` | Inline heredoc for `build_windows.bat` (`--make-build-script`) |
| 1422–1442 | `main()` | CLI dispatch (build-script flag vs. Tk `mainloop()`) |

### Key state inside `JustDownloadITApp`

```python
self.queue               # list[DownloadQueueItem]
self.current_queue_index # int, position during Process Queue
self.is_processing_queue # bool
self.download_thread     # Thread running _process_item_individual worker
self.recent              # list[dict], loaded from justdownloadit_recent.json
self.output_dir          # str, user-chosen save path
self.ffmpeg_path         # str|None, resolved at __init__
self._queue_widgets      # dict idx -> {row, icon, title, sub, prog}
```

## 8. UI System & Theming Conventions (HARD RULES FOR DEVS)

**Violating these will produce invisible / squashed text — as the earlier bugs showed.**

### 8.1 Color palette (always use these constants, NEVER hardcode)

All user text color must still be pure black (`#000000`) per project preference.

| Constant | Value | Used for |
|---|---|---|
| `BLACK` | `#000000` | All user-facing text (title, subtitle, label, button caption) |
| `GRAY_SUBTITLE` | `#4a4a4a` | Queue-item metadata subtitle + recent-list file path (readably dark, NOT disabled gray) |
| `BG_BLACK` | `#eaf4ff` | App background (pale sky-blue, "ice" theme). Misleading name — keep for back-compat |
| `PANEL` / `PANEL_2` | `#eaf4ff` / `#ffffff` | Card backgrounds (header + card content layers) |
| `ICE_BLUE` | `#bfe3ff` | Active state for icon button hovers |
| `ACCENT` | `#3aa0ff` | Progress bars, combo arrow, IconButton foreground, status colors |
| `SUCCESS_DARK` / `ERROR_DARK` / `WARN` | — | Queue row status icon colors |
| `SHADOW_1` / `SHADOW_OFFSET=2` | — | Layered shadow in custom widgets |

### 8.2 Custom widgets — 2-layer (shadow/border) + inner

Every themed container in this app uses the same pattern because native Tkinter has zero shadow/border support:

```
Outer Frame  (owns the shadow/drop-shadow layer, bg=SHADOW_1)
   └── Body Frame  (owns the highlight background/border, bg+highlightthickness+highlightbackground)
         └── Your content
```

- `IceButton`, `RoundedPanel`, `RoundedEntry`, `IconButton`, `ProgressWithLabel`, `SuccessBanner` ALL do this.
- **When adding children, put them inside `.body`** (e.g. `form = RoundedPanel(parent)` → `fb = form.body` → children go in `fb`).
- **The inner button in `IceButton` / `IconButton` MUST call `pack(fill="both", expand=True, padx=(0, SHADOW_OFFSET), pady=(0, SHADOW_OFFSET))`** — the offset creates the shadow illusion. If you forget `fill="both"` + `expand=True`, the button won't fill its container (see the Download-Button-narrow-inside-gray-bar bug).

### 8.3 Borders around text rows/labels

**DO NOT put `highlightthickness` directly on a `tk.Label`.** Tk draws the highlight *inside* the widget, stealing space from the text. Use this pattern:

```python
# WRONG: border on label  ->  text touches the border edges
tk.Label(..., pady=10, highlightthickness=2)

# RIGHT: border on outer Frame, label inside padding
wrap = tk.Frame(parent, bg=PANEL_2,
                highlightbackground=BORDER, highlightthickness=BORDER_THICK)
wrap.pack(fill="x")
tk.Label(wrap, text="...", padx=60, pady=90).pack(fill="both", expand=True)
```

This is applied to:
- Empty-state boxes (queue empty, recent empty) — see `q_empty_wrap` / `r_empty_wrap`
- Queue item rows / Recent rows — use `row` outer + `inner` inner (`padx=18, pady=28`/`24`)

### 8.4 IconButton foreground

`IconButton` foreground must be **`ACCENT`** (blue `#3aa0ff`), never `BLACK`. The button's background is `BG_BLACK` (also near-ice) so black-on-blue is **invisible** until hover — that was the original "invisible folder icon" bug. Confirmed via live validation:

```
IconButton fg=#3aa0ff bg=#eaf4ff   ->   100% contrast, visible always
```

### 8.5 Queue row labels: no accidental `state="disabled"`

A `tk.Label` with `state="disabled"` under some Windows themes renders in a grayed, etched style. **Always explicitly set `state="normal"`** on queue item title/subtitle/Recent labels even though it's the default — this is a defense against future copy-paste bugs. Pair it with:
- Title = `font=("Segoe UI", 10, "bold"), fg=BLACK` (solid bold black — maximum legibility)
- Subtitle = `font=FONT_LABEL ("Segoe UI 10 regular"), fg=GRAY_SUBTITLE`

---

## 9. File Persistence (State / JSON files)

### `justdownloadit_recent.json`

Location: same folder as `JustDownloadIT.py` or the `.exe`.

Shape:
```json
[
  {
    "path":  "C:/Users/aarav/Downloads/MyVideo.mp4",
    "title": "My Video Title",
    "url":   "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J6UTG09xko4",
    "ts":    1756818042.461
  }
]
```
- Capped at the **last 5 entries**.
- Written on every successful download; loaded at startup.

### No settings file yet

The original `icedown_settings.json` is a leftover from older versions and is **not** used by `JustDownloadIT`. Currently `default_format` / `default_quality` / `output_dir` are constants/one-time `__init__` values — if you add a Settings dialog, use `justdownloadit_settings.json` for symmetry.

---

## 10. Known Issues + Future Risks

### CURRENT (as of this build)

1. **`yt-dlp` site-extractor drift (MEDIUM)**
   - YouTube changes its response formats, cipher signatures, and endpoints regularly.
   - **Mitigation**: pinning a specific yt-dlp version in requirements for reproducible builds, and tell users that an old `.exe` will eventually need to be rebuilt against a newer `yt-dlp`.
   - Add an in-app "check for yt-dlp updates" helper if this goes long-term.

2. **ffmpeg Windows URL hard-coded (LOW)**
   - `FFMPEG_WIN_URL = "https://www.gyan.dev/ffmpeg/builds/ffmpeg-release-essentials.zip"` — if gyan.dev reorganizes their build archive, the first-time auto-download breaks on fresh Windows installs.
   - **Mitigation**: already bundled inside the `.exe` via `--add-binary`, so only end-users running from source (pip install) are affected. Add a fallback mirror or catch the HTTP error and show a download link in a messagebox.

3. **One-file PyInstaller cold-start (INFO)**
   - `--onefile` extracts ~140 MB of runtime to a temp `_MEIxxxxxx` folder on every launch. This is normal but feels slow on old HDDs (2–6 seconds).
   - Alternative is `--onedir` with a WiX/InnoSetup installer, but the project requirement was single-EXE portability.

4. **Windows Defender / SmartScreen false positive (LOW)**
   - Unsigned `.exe` files from PyInstaller trigger reputation-based AV warnings.
   - If distributing broadly: buy a code-signing cert (DigiCert/Sectigo OV, ~$70/yr), sign with `signtool sign /fd SHA256 /tr http://timestamp.digicert.com /td SHA256 dist\JustDownloadIT.exe`.

5. **Clip end-time fetch uses synchronous `extract_info` on the UI thread**
   - If the user only enters a *Start* time but no *End* time, `_add_to_queue` calls `fetch_video_duration` *synchronously*. For long videos or slow connections, the UI freezes for 1–5s.
   - Fix candidate: move the probe to a daemon thread + disable Add button until probe returns; show "Fetching duration…" in status_var.

6. **No playlist support**
   - `noplaylist=True` is hard-coded in ydl_opts and the URL parser. Users expect pasting a `?list=` URL to either download the whole list or show "use individual video URLs" — right now it silently picks only the first.
   - Future work: parse list URLs, add playlist header + per-video rows; strip the list param when fetching.

7. **Tk emoji rendering inconsistency across Windows versions**
   - 📄 🕒 📂 ✕ etc. use `Segoe UI Symbol` font. Older Windows 10 builds may render tofu boxes for newer codepoints.
   - Fallback: ship small PNG icons instead when this surfaces.

8. **`BORDER_THICK = 2` doubled on adjacent rows**
   - When two 1px-border rows stack, there is a 2px-looking seam between them because each row draws its own border. Use `highlightthickness=(1,1,1,0)` equivalent or only draw top-border except the first row if it ever becomes a visual issue.

### BUILD / CI RISKS

9. **`yt_dlp.__pyinstaller` hook optional deps**
   - The PyInstaller log during build reports `collect_data_files` warnings for `curl_cffi` and `yt_dlp_ejs`. These are warnings today but can become errors if a future yt-dlp hook treats them as required. When bumping yt-dlp, re-run the build and watch for ERROR-level messages.

10. **Python 3.13+ `tkinter` changes**
    - Python 3.13 already showed slight Tk init differences; `root.iconbitmap(default="")` is wrapped in try/except for that reason. When a new Python ships, always re-run the full `validate_ui.py`.

---

## 11. Validation / Regression Testing

Every UI/styling change must pass:

```bash
python validate_ui.py
```

This runs **31 checks** covering:
- No leftover `IceDown` references (rename integrity)
- `IconButton` fg is `ACCENT` & contrasts its `BG_BLACK` bg
- Queue/recent empty boxes use 2-layer pattern with `pady=90`
- Queue/recent item rows use 2-layer pattern with `inner pady=28/24`
- All title/subtitle labels have `state="normal"`, subtitle uses `GRAY_SUBTITLE`
- EXE exists and is the right size order-of-magnitude
- `_MEIPASS` / ffmpeg bundled path resolution is present in source
- **Live Tkinter probe** — actually instantiates the app, creates an IconButton, and inspects actual widget cget() values
- Adds a dummy queue item and inspects the dynamic-refresh padding

Expected output: `RESULT: 31/31 checks passed  ALL CHECKS PASSED ✓`

Additionally a machine-readable `validation_report.json` is written next to the script with individual statuses and detail strings — useful for pasting into PR comments or CI logs.

### Manual spot-check list after any build

1. ✅ App window shows "JustDownloadIT" as title and header
2. ✅ Remove/✕ icon on queue items is visible before hovering (NOT black-on-black)
3. ✅ Folder 📂 icon on completed recent items is visible before hovering
4. ✅ Empty "Queue is empty" box has massive white space **inside** the border above/below text, not text-touching
5. ✅ A real URL added to the queue shows title + metadata with the title in solid **bold black**, subtitle gray, progress bar below, nothing touches the top/bottom black line of the row
6. ✅ Run a download of a short YouTube video to confirm ffmpeg merge + saved path works end-to-end
7. ✅ Close the app, re-open — Recent Downloads panel still shows the item (JSON round-trip OK)
